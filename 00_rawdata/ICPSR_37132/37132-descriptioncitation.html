		        		<h2>Project Description:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> <p>The 2012 Collaborative Multi-racial Post-election Survey (CMPS) was a national survey of registered voters from three groups: White non-Hispanic adults, Black non-Hispanic adults, and English and Spanish speaking Hispanic adults. The survey was conducted between November 16, 2012 and November 26, 2012 in both English and Spanish, and examined individual's experiences with voting and attitudes about social and economic issues prominent in the 2012 election.</p>
<p>The 2012 CMPS included 37 items dealing with sociopolitical attitudes, mobilization political activity, advertising exposure and neighborhood context as well as three embedded survey experiments. Additionally, there were 15 items that capture demographic information, including: age, ancestry, birthplace, education, ethnicity, Latin American racial descriptors, skin color, marital status, household size, religiosity, gender, sexual orientation, internet usage, and residential context. Geographic variables below state level, such as city, county, Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) level, and Congressional district, are only available within the restricted-use data file for this collection.</p></span></p>

		        		<h2>Methodology:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Study Design:</strong> <p>The study was conducted by the GfK Group. Pretests of the survey were conducted between November 8, 2012 and November 19, 2012 in both English and Spanish. A Stata dataset containing the pretest interviews was reviewed prior to the main sample launch. Because changes were made to the main survey as a result of the pretest, the pretest interviews were not included as part of the main survey dataset.</p>
<p>Households were provided with access to the Internet and a netbook computer, if needed. Respondents were considered qualified if they did not refuse more than 4 of the first 7 questions in the survey. Those who refused 4 or more of the first 7 questions were terminated from the survey. The qualification rate was 99.8%.</p></span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Sample:</strong> <p>The 2012 Collaborative Multi-racial Post-election (CMPS) used probability-based web panels designed to be representative of the United States instead of "opt-in" panels that included only individuals with Internet access who volunteer themselves for research. As a result, panel members came from listed and unlisted telephone numbers, telephone and non-telephone households, and cell phone only households, as well as households with and without Internet access, which created a representative sample. Panel members were recruited through national random samples (both by telephone and mail).</p>
<p>To reduce the effects of any non-response and non-coverage bias in the overall panel membership, a post-stratification adjustment was applied based on demographic distributions from the most recent data from the Current Population Survey (CPS). An additional Spanish language adjustment was used based on the 2010 Pew Hispanic Center Survey (the most recent available published data at the time). Language usage adjustments allowed for the correct proportional fitting of Spanish-speaking members relative to other English-speaking Hispanic and non-Hispanic panel members within Census regions.</p></span></p>
								<div><strong>Time Method:</strong> <p>Cross-sectional</p></div>
								<p><span><strong>Universe:</strong> The Collaborative Multi-racial Post-election Survey (CMPS) 2012 is comprised of 2,616 registered voters who self-identified as Black (n=804), Latino (n=934), or White (n=878).</span></p>
								<div><strong>Unit(s) of Observation:</strong> <p>Individual</p></div>
								<div><strong>Data Type(s):</strong> <p>survey data</p></div>
								<div><strong>Mode of Data Collection:</strong> <p>web-based survey</p></div>
								<p><span><strong>Description of Variables:</strong> <p>The following geographic variables are only available in the restricted-use data file for this collection: CITY (City), FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code), CBSAMET (Core Based Metropolitan Statistical Area), CD112 (112th congressional district), and CD113 (113th congressional district).</p>
<p>In addition, to protect respondent confidentiality and prevent disclosure risk, ICPSR has modified variables within the public-use data file as follows:
<ul>
<li>PPAGE (Age) was collapsed into categories</li>
<li>PPHHSIZE (Household size), PPT18OV (Presence of household members - adults 18+), Q31 (How many years have you lived at your present address?), and Q31A (In the past 5 years, how many different addresses have you lived at?) were top-coded</li>
<li>PPEDUC (Education (highest degree received)) was bottom-coded</li>
<li>Q4B_03_SPECIFY ([Another candidate, please specify] In the 2012 election for president, did you vote for (Republican Mitt Romney/Democrat Barack Obama) or someone else?) responses were masked</li>
<li>Q36A (What are the two or three most important reasons you expect to move from your current address?) responses containing detailed geographic and demographic information were spot-masked</li>
</ul>
</p></span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Response Rates:</strong> The median completion time of the survey was 20 minutes and the completion rate was 56.3%</span></p>

								<p><span><strong>Original Release Date:</strong> 2020-11-12</span></p>
								<div><strong>Version History:</strong> <p>2020-11-13 Updated documentation to reflect a P.I. name change. Removed two geographic variables from the public-use and restricted-use data per P.I request.<p><p>2020-11-12 ICPSR data undergo a confidentiality review and are altered when necessary to limit the risk of disclosure. ICPSR also routinely creates ready-to-go data files along with setups in the major statistical software formats as well as standard codebooks to accompany the data. In addition to these procedures, ICPSR performed the following processing steps for this data collection:</p><ul><li>Created online analysis version with question text.</li><li>Checked for undocumented or out-of-range codes.</li></ul></p></div>
		        		<h2>Analysis Information:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Weight:</strong> Post-stratification weights WEIGHT1 and WEIGHT2 are available to adjust for survey non-response as well as
non-coverage or under- and over-sampling resulting from the study-specific sample design, and should be used in any analyses.</span></p>
